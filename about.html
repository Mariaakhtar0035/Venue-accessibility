    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p2>We were tasked with the goal to help make a client dealing with spina biffda's life a little simpler. For many in wheelchairs, the idea of going to concerts at large venues can cause a lot of anxiety. It is difficult to find accesibility information surrounding dimensions as well as transportation to concert venues. For this reason, we developed this app to compile all information one would need in order to take some of the weight of the shoulders when it comes to going to concerts in a wheelchair.</p2>
